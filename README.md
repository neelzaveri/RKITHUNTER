# RKITHUNTER
RKitHunt (Rootkit Hunter) is a lightweight Bash-based security auditing tool designed to detect signs of rootkits, malware, and backdoors on Linux systems.  It performs multiple forensic checks to identify hidden processes, suspicious kernel modules, backdoored binaries, and other anomalies used by attackers to persist on compromised systems.
