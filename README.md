# RKITHUNTER
RKitHunt (Rootkit Hunter) is a lightweight Bash-based security auditing tool designed to detect signs of rootkits, malware, and backdoors on Linux systems.  It performs multiple forensic checks to identify hidden processes, suspicious kernel modules, backdoored binaries, and other anomalies used by attackers to persist on compromised systems.

**✨ Features of RootKHunter**

Detects **hidden processes and reports** suspicious activity.

Identifies **hidden files and directories** with ownership & permissions.

Scans for **suspicious kernel modules** (possible rootkit implants).

Verifies **integrity of system binaries** using SHA256 hashes.

Checks **common rootkit files, strings, and signatures.**

Monitors **network ports & anomalies.**

Interactive menu-driven interface for **ease of use.**


**📦 Installation**

Clone the repository and make the script executable:

git clone https://github.com/neelzaveri/rkithunt.git

chmod +x rkithunt.sh


**🚀 Usage**

Run the tool with root privileges for full detection:

sudo ./rkithunt.sh


**🛠️ Requirements**

- Linux system (tested on Debian/Ubuntu, compatible with most distros)
